# 2D-Pose-Estimation
Pose Estimation using OpenPose (Deep Learning with OpenCV)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of this project is to create a computer vision model that identifies key points related to human anatomy and establishes logical connections between these key points. The utilized model is a pre-trained OpenPose model developed by Carnegie Mellon University, generating two types of outputs: Confidence Maps and Part Affinity Maps. The code demonstration focuses on a single person in the image, employing Confidence Maps, also referred to as Probability Maps.
