# 2D-Pose-Estimation
Pose Estimation using OpenPose (Deep Learning with OpenCV)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project aims to develop a computer vision model to detect the key points associated with the humans anotomy and logically connect the key points. The model used is an pretrained model Open-Pose developed by Carnegie Mellon University, it produces 2 types of outputs Confidence Maps and Part Affinity Maps. The code demonstration will be using single person in the image therefore I have used Confidence Maps aslo known as Probability Maps.
